    lyric:'''I know I stand in line, until you think you have the time
To spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance, I know that there's a chance
You won't be leaving with me
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
And have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all
By saying something stupid like "I love you"
I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies
You heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you
For me it's true, it never seemed so right before
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say
To make the meaning come through
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late
And I'm alone with you
The time is right your perfume fills my head
The stars get red and oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all
By saying something stupid like "I love you"
The time is right your perfume fills my head
The stars get red and oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all
By saying something stupid like "I love you"
I love you
I love you
I love you''',

난 삐그덕 삐그덕
걸음걸이 고장 나 버린 듯이 Walk
Don’t care bout’ a thang
난 내 기분대로 Walk
걸음걸이 고장 난 듯이 삐그덕

누가 봐도 나처럼 난 걷지 On the beat
박자에 맞게 미끄러져 걸음이
좌우로 흔들리지 난 메트로놈의 침
늘 여유롭지 원래 내 일이 Chill

눈길을 끌지
내가 그 원인
Get out my way yuh
Cuz I’ll be bussin’
문제는 다 Pass pass
다 털어내 먼지
굳이 시간 쓰지 않지 난

난 시선을 뺏어
I see you crushin’
나는 좀 바뻐
난 Wall to wall
여유가 뱄어
언제든 난 Step in
떠나보낸
Good good good good night

걸음걸이 고장 나 버린 듯이 Walk
Don’t care bout’ a thang

Don’t care bout’ a thang
난 내 기분대로 Walk
걸음걸이 고장 난 듯이 삐그덕


내버려둬 I just can not stop
모든 문을 두드리지 Knock knock
쏟아지는 빛, 익숙해져 난 (For real)
내 두 손에 쏟아지는 Like like

여름에도 떠는 Phone
고장 나 버려 난 삐용 삐용
비켜 내 앞에 끼지 말아 위험 위험
빨리
비켜봐 On my way
좀 더 삐걱대게
Do ma dance do ma dance
걸음마저 Step step

눈길을 끌지
내가 그 원인
Get out my way yuh
Cuz I’ll be bussin’
문제는 다 Pass pass

매겨 난 백 점
상을 줘 넌

Something lost and never seen
Every time I start to believe
Something's raped and taken from me, from me
Life's gotta always be messing with me (you wanna see the light)
Can't they chill and let me be free? (So do I)
Can't I take away all this pain? (You wanna see the light)
I try to every night, all in vain, in vain
Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace
Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me
Feeling like a freak on a leash (you wanna see the light)
Feeling like I have no release (so do I)
How many times have I felt diseased? (You wanna see the light)
Nothing in my life is free, is free
Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace
Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay

You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time, I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily
Don't wanna know
Kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain

Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you might want me to
Come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain

Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore

So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

I'm in love with your body
(Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)

I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me

I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice, I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot, second chances

Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Ooh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'll take every single piece of the blame, if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Ooh, is it too late now to say I'm sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm not just trying to get you back on me
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?''',

    lyric:'''Telling myself I won't go there
Oh, but I know that I won't care
Tryna wash away all the blood I've spilt
This lust is a burden that we both share
Two sinners can't atone from a lone prayer
Souls tied, intertwined by our pride and guilt
There's darkness in the distance
From the way that I've been livin'
But I know I can't resist it
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Tellin' myself it's the last time
Can you spare any mercy that you might find
If I'm down on my knees again?
Deep down, way down, Lord, I try
Try to follow your light, but it's night time
Please, don't leave me in the end
There's darkness in the distance
I'm beggin' for forgiveness (ooh)
But I know I might resist it, oh
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time''',

    lyric:'''Let me introduce you to my party people in the club, huh
It's a new generation of party people
Get 'em up, yeah
If you go hard, you gotta get on the floor
If you're a party freak, then step on the floor
If you're an animal, then tear up the floor
Break a sweat on the floor
Yeah, we work on the floor
Don't stop, keep it moving, put your drinks up
Pick your body up and drop it on the floor
Let the rhythm change your world on the floor
You know we're running shit tonight on the floor
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza
Straight to LA, New York, Vegas to Africa
Dance the night away
Live your life and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
I know you got it, clap your hands on the floor
And keep on rocking, rock it up on the floor
If you're a criminal, kill it on the floor
Steal it quick on the floor, on the floor
Don't stop, keep it moving, put your drinks up
It's getting ill, it's getting sick on the floor
We never quit, we never rest on the floor
If I ain't wrong, we'll probably die on the floor
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza
Straight to LA, New York, Vegas to Africa
Dance the night away
Live your life and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
Break it off
Kick it out
Raise the roof
Wreck the dancehall
Rip these walls
Light it up
Make some noise, oh
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor''',
